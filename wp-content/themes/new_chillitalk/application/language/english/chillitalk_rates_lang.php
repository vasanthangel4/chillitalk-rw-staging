<p>The rates for calling a cellphone are a little higher in most countries. Check country-specific rates on our website, which always has the most up-to-date rates for each country.

</p>
<h3>Are there any additional charges or hidden fees? </h3> 
<p>
We are honest and transparent about our prices. We simply charge you the per-minute rate for calls advertised on our site, so when you make a payment the full amount is added to your calling credit. There are no connection charges, maintenance/service charges or other hidden costs. 
</p>
  
<h3>Is there a rate difference if I call from my home or cellphone? 	 </h3> 
<p>No, there is no difference. You get the same low rates whether you use your landline or cellphone. The only difference might be when calling the Access Number via cellphone and not using your free minutes. If you call using an Access Number but have no free inclusive minutes, you should be charged at your provider’s usual landline rate. </p>
    
<h3>Why can I make free calls to other Chillitalk users, but am charged for other calls?   </h3> 
   
<p> Calls to other Chillitalk users are free because they are not made over conventional phone lines like regular phone calls; they’re made using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology, which connects callers via the internet or similar digital networks. </p>
   
<h3>Will I be charged by my landline/cellphone provider for calling your Access Numbers?  </h3> 
   
<p>As local landline numbers your Access Numbers should be covered by any free minute allocation in your PAYG or contract. If you don’t have any free inclusive minutes you should be charged at your provider’s usual landline rate. 
</p>
<h3>Will my phone carrier charge me when I call from my cellphone using Chillitalk? </h3> 
   
<p>Chillitalk Local Number calls are charged by your phone carrier as a local call. So if you have unlimited free calling minutes with your PAYG or contract you should not be charged by your phone carrier.

<br/><br/>
Use the Chillitalk App and you can make a call using the internet instead of a Local Number. This means you will be charged for the data but not for a local call. If you have an unlimited data plan your phone carrier will not charge you; should you not have an unlimited data plan, your phone carrier will charge you as normal for data usage.
