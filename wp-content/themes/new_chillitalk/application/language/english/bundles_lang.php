Let’s imagine you choose your mother’s Sri Lankan number as your contact. You could then, for example, 
register your own mobile, your wife’s mobile and your brother’s mobile all to one Home Saver account. 
Your wife, brother and anyone in your household could then share your 1500-minute allowance – keeping your entire 
family in touch.
<br/><br/>
So let’s recap – Sri Lanka Home Saver gives you 1500 minutes to call your chosen Sri Lankan number, shared between:<br/>
•	Any 3 mobile numbers<br/><br/>
•	And any one landline number, for example your home landline ...for just £15<br/><br/>
Chillitalk Home Saver: the perfect way for you and your family to keep in touch with your loved ones.
