Can I use Chillitalk from an unregistered phone, such as a public phone or a friend’s phone?</h3><p>
Yes. However, to be certain it is you we will ask for an 11-digit PIN. You can find this number by logging into your ‘My Account’ section.
</p><h3>How do I make an international call using Chillitalk? </h3>
<p>Make sure you call from a registered phone. Then call the Chillitalk Local Number assigned to the contact you wish to call. Make sure you have enough credit in your account for your call to be connected.
</p>
<h3>Why am I asked for a PIN when I make a Local Numbers call? </h3>
<p>There are two reasons why this might happen:<br/>  <br/>
1. You have called from a number not registered with us. <br/>  <br/>
2. Your Caller ID is hidden. This means we can’t identify your phone and will ask for your account number and PIN. Your Caller ID is the number displayed when you call someone. If you enable your caller ID we should be able to identify your phone and won’t need to ask for your PIN.
</p>
<h3>Calls are connecting to the wrong numbers – why? </h3>
<p>If you call from a phone number registered on a different Chillitalk account, then you could be connected to the wrong person, because Local Numbers aren't unique to you or your account. Local numbers are assigned to more than one account. Call from a phone registered to your account and a Local Number will <italics>connect you to the contact associated with that Local Number on your account.</italics> But called from someone else's registered phone a Local Number will divert you to their associated contact, not yours. </p>");
