           Chillitalk is a dynamic and expanding company based in the UK, with headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf, the international finance and business centre. At Chillitalk, our team reflects this global diversity, and we pride ourselves in building our business on a strong, multinational intellect.  <br/><br/>
            
            Chillitalk is brand of the Mundio Group, and our mission is to make international calling affordable for everyone – whoever they are, wherever they are. We have been doing this successfully for over 15 years now, and millions of customers worldwide use our services to stay in touch with their loved ones. <br/><br/>
Our London office overlooks the calm waters of South Quay docks, providing a great contrast to the fast, exciting pace of our business, where we are hard at work developing a range of fresh products waiting to be launched.  <br/><br/>
Chillitalk is built on visionary ideas, realised and implemented by dedicated people who love the work they do. If you would like to be part of the Chillitalk team, we’d be delighted to hear from you.
